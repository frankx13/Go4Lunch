# Go4Lunch Android App

This application was my 5th project for my OpenClassroom path, its purpose is to make meals more easy to plan for co-workers amongst
a team, by providing a list of restaurant and workmates. 
One can easily see if its colleagues chose a place to eat yet, or can create
one, that will be displayed to all its workmates.

The application is developed in Java with Android Studio, is targetting Android devices and use Firebase for back-end.
